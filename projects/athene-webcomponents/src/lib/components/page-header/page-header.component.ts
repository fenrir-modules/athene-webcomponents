/**
 * The page head every app page uses: H1, one muted meta line, actions on
 * the right, a hairline underneath. The breadcrumb lives in the shell's
 * topbar, so this component starts at the page gutter like every other.
 *
 * - Meta: `subItems` strings render with `·` separators. Anything richer
 *   (a health pill, an avatar) goes in an `[athPageMeta]` child, which
 *   continues the same line.
 * - Leading: an `[athPageLeading]` child (e.g. a project key tile) sits
 *   left of the title block.
 * - Actions: default content. At most one primary; the topbar's "New" is
 *   already the view's primary on most pages.
 * - `divider`: the hairline. Turn it off only when the next element draws
 *   its own rule directly under the head (an underline tab bar).
 * - Height: a page head (level 1) is one height whatever it holds — the
 *   meta line keeps its room while it is empty or still loading, so a late
 *   meta never pushes the page down. `loading` draws title and meta as
 *   skeleton bars. A section head (level 2) folds an empty meta line.
 *
 * @example
 * <ath-page-header title="Tickets" [subItems]="['12 of 45', 'across 6 projects']">
 *   <ath-button variant="secondary" size="sm">Filter</ath-button>
 * </ath-page-header>
